# Tic-tac-toe

A simple tic-tac-toe made in C. Small project for learning purposes.  ̶S̶t̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶n̶e̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶ ̶t̶e̶x̶t̶ ̶g̶r̶a̶p̶h̶i̶c̶s̶.̶ ̶W̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶e̶k̶ ̶i̶t̶s̶e̶l̶f̶.̶  (It's done)
That's it. The computer randomly generates Os and we place Xs at the proper location.
